I am a data scientist with an interest in machine learning and a passion for uncovering hidden patterns within data. The continuous growth of data and rapid advancements in algorithms and techniques fascinate me, and I am excited about the potential discoveries they enable.

I enjoy researching and experimenting with state-of-the-art methods, often applying them to my own projects. These projects span various domains I am well-versed in, including supply chain, manufacturing machinery, healthcare/bioinformatics, basketball, golf, eSports, and other areas that capture my curiosity.

Some of my current/recent projects include:

- A full-stack analytics platform for tracking the professional Valorant Esports league (VCT).

- Custom designed Elo ratings
- Statsically derived match predictions
- Advanced data visualizations of team and player perfromance
- Monte Carlo simulations of upcoming tournaments
- Modern ML techiniques to predict future player performance

All done with a fully automated ETL process and hosted live via Vercel.

- A computer vision model for player tracking in professional basketball. This model tracks metrics such as player speed, total distance traveled, and time of possession while also visualizing the player's name and number with the ball. Includes an application to record box score stats solely using computer vision.

- A voting application to model users political preferences via natural language conversation with fine-tuned LLM's and Reinforcemnt Learning methods on prefered voting behavior.

  An application showcasing the thought experiment of if Democracy via indiviudal  
  algorithms rather than elected representatives could be viable.

You can check out my completed projects (or at least those with interesting versions) in greater detail on the portfolio tab of this website.

After graduating from Michigan State University in 2021 with a degree in Economics, I stumbled upon a YouTube documentary about AlphaGo, the AI developed by DeepMind to play Go. This documentary inspired me, not only because of the AI's capabilities but also the remarkable team behind its creation.

This led me on a deep dive into state-of-the-art machine learning approaches over the past two and a half years. I have developed a practical focus on computer vision applications and supply chain/manufacturing optimization techniques. Additionally, I am academically fascinated by the architecture of intelligent machines, particularly the concepts of Active Inference and Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle.

Currently, I am employed at STARS Advanced Radiology Services, where I specialize in delivering business and clinical productivity insights through dashboards, reports, and predictive modeling.
