I am a data scientist with an interest in machine learning and a passion for uncovering hidden patterns within data. The continuous growth of data and rapid advancements in algorithms and techniques fascinate me, and I am excited about the potential discoveries they enable.

I enjoy researching and experimenting with state-of-the-art methods, often applying them to my own projects. These projects span various domains I am well-versed in, including supply chain, manufacturing machinery, healthcare/bioinformatics, basketball, golf, eSports, and other areas that capture my curiosity.

Some of my current/recent projects include:

- A dashboard visualizing an ELO rating calculation I developed to approximate professional Valorant teams' skill levels on specific maps.

- A warehouse inventory application that handles order entry, product delivery, and sales. The application includes a sales forecasting model that creates optimal product purchases and store deliveries based on the modelâ€™s recommended warehouse and store inventory levels.

- A computer vision model for player tracking in professional basketball. This model tracks metrics such as player speed, total distance traveled, and time of possession while also visualizing the player's name and number with the ball.

You can check out my completed projects (or at least those with interesting versions) in greater detail on the portfolio tab of this website.

After graduating from Michigan State University in 2021 with a degree in Economics, I stumbled upon a YouTube documentary about AlphaGo, the AI developed by DeepMind to play Go. This documentary inspired me, not only because of the AI's capabilities but also the remarkable team behind its creation.

This led me on a deep dive into state-of-the-art machine learning approaches over the past two and a half years. I have developed a practical focus on computer vision applications and supply chain/manufacturing optimization techniques. Additionally, I am academically fascinated by the architecture of intelligent machines, particularly the concepts of Active Inference and Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle.

Currently, I am employed at STARS Advanced Radiology Services, where I specialize in delivering business and clinical productivity insights through dashboards, reports, and predictive modeling.

I am planning on writing "blogs'' as an effort to think through my own understanding of topics that I am reading about or have recently applied. These will likely be glorified note taking however as I improve I hope to reach a point where they may be useful to someone looking for some interesting thoughts on a subject of interest.
