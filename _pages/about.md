I am a data scientist with a deep interest in machine learning.

After graduating from Michigan State University in 2021 with a degree in Economics. I watched the AlphaGo documentary and was thoroughly inspired by the models capabilities but even more so by the team behind its creation.

This began a deep dive self learning journey over the past 2 1/2 years into SOTA Machine Learning approaches.

I have found specific practical interest in the fields of Computer Vision applications and Supply Chain/Manufacturing Optimization techniques.

I have also become academically curious about architecting intelligent machines especially with regard to the ideas of Active Inference and Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle.

I am currently employed at STARS Advanced Radiology Services where I primarily work on delivering business and clinical productivity insights in the form of dashboards, reports, and predictive modeling.

My personal interests outside of Machine Learning include Basketball, Video Games, and Hiking (as evidenced by my profile picture which was taken in the Grand Canyon on our way to Havasupai).

If you read all of this and are interested in chatting feel free to message me on X/Twitter or on LinkedIn.
