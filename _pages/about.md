I am a data scientist with a profound interest in machine learning. My passion for uncovering underlying trends in data dates back to middle school when I created metrics from aggregating counting stats in the major four sports to determine the player I believed should win MVP in each league. Today, I channel this enthusiasm into projects that involve building dashboards, applications, predictive models, and computer vision models.

Some of my current/recent projects include:

- A dashboard visualizing an ELO rating calculation I developed to approximate professional Valorant teams' skill levels on specific maps.

- A warehouse inventory application that handles order entry, product delivery, and sales. The application includes a sales forecasting model that creates optimal product purchases and store deliveries based on the models recommended warehouse and store inventory levels.

- A computer vision model for player tracking in professional basketball. This model tracks metrics such as player speed, total distance traveled, and time of possession while also visualizing the player's name and number with the ball.

You can check out my completed projects (or at least those with interesting versions) in greater detail on the portfolio tab of this website.

After graduating from Michigan State University in 2021 with a degree in Economics, I stumbled upon a YouTube documentary about AlphaGo, the AI developed by DeepMind to play Go. This documentary inspired me, not only because of the AI's capabilities but also due to the remarkable team behind its creation.

This led me on a deep dive into state-of-the-art machine learning approaches over the past two and a half years. I have developed a practical focus on computer vision applications and supply chain/manufacturing optimization techniques. Additionally, I am academically fascinated by the architecture of intelligent machines, particularly the concepts of Active Inference and Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle.

Currently, I am employed at STARS Advanced Radiology Services, where I specialize in delivering business and clinical productivity insights through dashboards, reports, and predictive modeling.

Outside of my professional pursuits in machine learning, I enjoy basketball, chess, video games, and hiking. My profile picture, taken at the Grand Canyon, captures one of my many adventures.
