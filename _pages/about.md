I am a data scientist with a profound interest in machine learning. I love uncovering the mysteries that hide with in data and I am especially excited about the amazing things we can uncover with the combination of ever increasing amounts of data and the advancements of algorithms and techniques that happen seemingly everyday. I enjoy researching and trying out the latest state of the art methods. I typically do so on my own personal projects which are typically set in a domain that I am well versed in. Some of these domains include Basketball, Golf, ESports, Supply Chain, Manufacturing machinery, Healthcare/bioinformatics, or whatever else peaks my interest for long enough for me to do some research on.

Some of my current/recent projects include:

- A dashboard visualizing an ELO rating calculation I developed to approximate professional Valorant teams' skill levels on specific maps.

- A warehouse inventory application that handles order entry, product delivery, and sales. The application includes a sales forecasting model that creates optimal product purchases and store deliveries based on the models recommended warehouse and store inventory levels.

- A computer vision model for player tracking in professional basketball. This model tracks metrics such as player speed, total distance traveled, and time of possession while also visualizing the player's name and number with the ball.

You can check out my completed projects (or at least those with interesting versions) in greater detail on the portfolio tab of this website.

After graduating from Michigan State University in 2021 with a degree in Economics, I stumbled upon a YouTube documentary about AlphaGo, the AI developed by DeepMind to play Go. This documentary inspired me, not only because of the AI's capabilities but also the remarkable team behind its creation.

This led me on a deep dive into state-of-the-art machine learning approaches over the past two and a half years. I have developed a practical focus on computer vision applications and supply chain/manufacturing optimization techniques. Additionally, I am academically fascinated by the architecture of intelligent machines, particularly the concepts of Active Inference and Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle.

Currently, I am employed at STARS Advanced Radiology Services, where I specialize in delivering business and clinical productivity insights through dashboards, reports, and predictive modeling.

I am planning on writing "blogs" as an effort to think through my own understanding of topics that I am reading about or have recently applied. These will likely be glorified notetaking however as I improve I hope to reach a point where they may be useful to someone looking for some interesting thoughts on a subject of interest.

Outside of my professional pursuits in machine learning, I enjoy basketball, chess, video games, and hiking. My profile picture, taken at the Grand Canyon, captures one of my many adventures.
